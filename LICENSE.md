This Software License Agreement (the "Agreement") governs the use of the software and associated documentation files (the "Software") known as UIRP - Universal Intelligent ROS Platform, developed by Kiran Karthikeyan Achari ("Licensor"). By using, copying, modifying, merging, publishing, distributing, or sublicensing the Software, you ("Licensee") agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

**1. Grant of License**

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Licensor grants Licensee two distinct types of licenses:

*   **1.1 Non-Commercial Use License:**

    *   Licensor grants Licensee a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, copy, modify, merge, and distribute the Software for **Non-Commercial Purposes only**.
    *   "Non-Commercial Purposes" are defined as use that is *primarily* intended for:
        *   Personal use.
        *   Educational use (e.g., teaching, academic research, student projects).
        *   Research use by non-profit organizations.
        *   Evaluation or testing of the Software.
    *   This Non-Commercial Use License *requires* attribution as described in Section 3.

*   **1.2 Commercial Use License:**

    *   Licensor grants Licensee a non-exclusive, worldwide license to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, and sublicense the Software for **Commercial Purposes**, *subject to the payment of a compensation or royalty* as agreed upon separately with Licensor.
    *   "Commercial Purposes" are defined as any use that is *primarily* intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or monetary compensation. This includes, but is not limited to:

A separate written agreement, signed by both Licensor and Licensee, is *required* for any Commercial Use.  This separate agreement will supersede the terms of this Section 1.2 *only* with respect to the specific commercial use covered by that agreement. All other terms of this License Agreement remain in full force and effect.

**Detailed Explanation and Important Notes:**

*   **Dual License:** This license provides *two* separate licenses: one for non-commercial use (free, with attribution) and one for commercial use (requiring separate negotiation and payment). This is a common approach for projects that want to encourage open-source use but also monetize commercial applications.
*   **Clear Definitions:**  The license carefully defines "Non-Commercial Purposes" and "Commercial Purposes" to avoid ambiguity.
*   **Mandatory Separate Agreement:**  The license makes it *absolutely clear* that any commercial use requires a separate, written agreement with you, the Licensor. This is crucial for protecting your rights.  This separate agreement *overrides* the general commercial use terms in the main license *only for the specific commercial use covered by that agreement*.
*   **Very Strict Attribution:**  The attribution requirements are very detailed and specific, leaving little room for misinterpretation.  They specify *what* to include, *where* to include it, and even recommend an attribution statement.
*   **No Loopholes (Attempt):**  The license is structured to be as comprehensive as possible within the constraints of a relatively simple, custom license.  It addresses common loopholes by:
    *   Explicitly requiring attribution for *both* non-commercial and commercial use.
    *   Clearly defining commercial use.
    *   Requiring a separate written agreement for *any* commercial use.
    *   Making it clear that the separate agreement only overrides the payment terms, not the other license conditions (like attribution).
    *   Including a termination clause.
    *   Specifying governing law.
    *   Including an "entire agreement" clause.
    *   Including a severability clause.
*   **Reverse Engineering**: I have permitted the reverse engineering for better use and development.
*   **Placeholders:**  Remember to replace `[Your Repository URL]` and `[Your Country/State]` with your actual information.
*   **Disclaimer (Not Legal Advice):**  This is *still not legal advice*. While this license is significantly more robust and tailored to your specific needs, it is *essential* to understand that I am an AI and cannot provide legal advice.  **For any commercial use, or if you have any doubts about the legal enforceability of this license, you *must* consult with a qualified attorney.** They can review the license, advise you on its implications, and ensure it complies with the laws of your jurisdiction.  A lawyer can also help you draft the separate commercial use agreements.

This improved license provides much stronger protection for your intellectual property while still allowing non-commercial use.  The key is the requirement for a separate, negotiated agreement for *any* commercial use, giving you complete control over the terms of commercialization. However, always consult with a lawyer for definitive legal advice.

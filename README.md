## Overview

**UIRP (Universal Intelligent ROS Platform)** is a modular, scalable, and AI-driven robotics platform built on the [Robot Operating System (ROS)](https://www.ros.org/). It integrates advanced machine learning, sensor fusion, and autonomous navigation into a unified solution. This project is part of a larger thesis effort titled **"Smart ROS Platform Thesis"**, aiming to streamline the development and deployment of autonomous robotic systems.

### Goals

-   Provide a **universal** platform that supports multiple robot types (ground, aerial, manipulator arms, etc.).
-   Simplify **AI integration** within ROS ecosystems, making it easier to add machine learning and deep learning components.
-   Ensure **scalability** and **modularity**, enabling flexible and reusable architectures for different robotics applications.
-   Serve as a **foundational thesis project** that demonstrates cutting-edge ROS practices, advanced autonomy, and real-world deployability.

## Key Features

1.  **Modular ROS Packages**
    -   Each functional area (e.g., navigation, perception, AI modules) is contained within its own package.
    -   Encourages reusable code and organized development.

2.  **AI-Driven Decision Making**
    -   Supports integration of machine learning and deep learning models (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).
    -   Allows for online or offline inference for real-time decision making.

3.  **Sensor Fusion**
    -   Combines data from multiple sensors (LIDAR, camera, IMU, etc.) to enhance perception and accuracy.
    -   Utilizes algorithms like Extended Kalman Filters, Particle Filters, or custom fusion nodes.

4.  **Autonomous Navigation**
    -   Built on top of ROS navigation stacks (e.g., `move_base` in ROS1, `nav2` in ROS2).
    -   Includes path planning, obstacle avoidance, and global/local planners.

5.  **Scalable Architecture**
    -   Designed to work with a wide range of robot platforms.
    -   Easily configurable through ROS parameter files and launch scripts.

6.  **Thesis-Focused Documentation**
    -   In-depth explanations of the underlying algorithms, design decisions, and trade-offs.
    -   Intended for both academic research and real-world robotics applications.

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

-   **ROS Version**
    -   Either ROS1 (e.g., **Noetic**) or ROS2 (e.g., **Foxy**, **Galactic**, **Humble**).
    -   Ensure you have a compatible OS (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04 for ROS Noetic, Ubuntu 22.04 for ROS2 Humble).
-   **Python Version**
    -   Python 3.x (depending on ROS distribution, e.g., Python 3.8 for Ubuntu 20.04).
-   **System Dependencies**
    -   `build-essential`, `cmake`, `git`, etc.
    -   `python3-pip` if you need additional Python packages.
-   **Additional Packages**
    -   For AI modules: `tensorflow` or `torch` (optional).
    -   For sensor fusion: `robot_localization`, `cartographer`, or any other specialized packages.

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    cd ~/catkin_ws/src  # or colcon_ws/src for ROS2
    git clone [https://github.com/kiranvenom1209/UIRP.git](https://github.com/kiranvenom1209/UIRP.git)
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    # Example dependencies:
    sudo apt-get install ros-${ROS_DISTRO}-navigation ros-${ROS_DISTRO}-robot-localization
    # For AI (optional):
    pip3 install tensorflow==2.6.0  # or torch==1.10.0,  Adjust versions as needed.
    ```
    It's highly recommended to use `rosdep` to install ROS dependencies:
    ```bash
    rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
    ```

3.  **Build the Workspace**

    -   **ROS1 (Catkin):**

        ```bash
        cd ~/catkin_ws
        catkin_make
        source devel/setup.bash
        ```

    -   **ROS2 (Colcon):**

        ```bash
        cd ~/colcon_ws
        colcon build
        source install/setup.bash
        ```

4.  **Environment Setup**

    Add `source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash` (ROS1) or `source ~/colcon_ws/install/setup.bash` (ROS2) to your `~/.bashrc` to avoid repeating setup commands.  Configure any environment variables needed by AI modules or sensor fusion nodes in your `.bashrc` or a separate `.env` file.  It's good practice to use a virtual environment for Python dependencies.

## Usage

-   **Launch the Main System**

    ```bash
    # ROS1 Example:
    roslaunch uirp main.launch

    # ROS2 Example:
    ros2 launch uirp main.launch.py
    ```

    This command typically starts up all essential nodes: AI inference node, sensor fusion node, navigation stack, etc.

-   **Simulation**

    ```bash
    # For a Gazebo simulation (example):
    roslaunch uirp simulation.launch  # or .launch.py for ROS2
    ```

    This will spawn a virtual robot in Gazebo (or another simulator) with all the relevant sensors.

-   **Configuration & Parameters**

    -   Located in `config/`.
    -   Adjust these YAML files to match your robot's sensor setup or AI model paths.

-   **Command-Line Arguments**

    You can pass additional arguments to modify behavior (e.g., `use_sim_time:=true`, `robot_model:=my_robot_x`).

    Example:

    ```bash
    roslaunch uirp main.launch use_sim_time:=true robot_model:=my_robot_x
    ```

## Overview

**UIRP (Universal Intelligent ROS Platform)** is a modular, scalable, and AI-driven robotics platform built on the [Robot Operating System (ROS)](https://www.ros.org/). It integrates advanced machine learning, sensor fusion, and autonomous navigation into a unified solution. This project is part of a larger thesis effort titled **“Smart ROS Platform Thesis”**, aiming to streamline the development and deployment of autonomous robotic systems.

### Goals

- Provide a **universal** platform that supports multiple robot types (ground, aerial, manipulator arms, etc.).  
- Simplify **AI integration** within ROS ecosystems, making it easier to add machine learning and deep learning components.  
- Ensure **scalability** and **modularity**, enabling flexible and reusable architectures for different robotics applications.  
- Serve as a **foundational thesis project** that demonstrates cutting-edge ROS practices, advanced autonomy, and real-world deployability.

## Key Features

1. **Modular ROS Packages**  
   - Each functional area (e.g., navigation, perception, AI modules) is contained within its own package.  
   - Encourages reusable code and organized development.

2. **AI-Driven Decision Making**  
   - Supports integration of machine learning and deep learning models (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).  
   - Allows for online or offline inference for real-time decision making.

3. **Sensor Fusion**  
   - Combines data from multiple sensors (LIDAR, camera, IMU, etc.) to enhance perception and accuracy.  
   - Utilizes algorithms like Extended Kalman Filters, Particle Filters, or custom fusion nodes.

4. **Autonomous Navigation**  
   - Built on top of ROS navigation stacks (e.g., `move_base` in ROS1, `nav2` in ROS2).  
   - Includes path planning, obstacle avoidance, and global/local planners.

5. **Scalable Architecture**  
   - Designed to work with a wide range of robot platforms.  
   - Easily configurable through ROS parameter files and launch scripts.

6. **Thesis-Focused Documentation**  
   - In-depth explanations of the underlying algorithms, design decisions, and trade-offs.  
   - Intended for both academic research and real-world robotics applications.

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- **ROS Version**  
  - Either ROS1 (e.g., **Noetic**) or ROS2 (e.g., **Foxy**, **Galactic**, **Humble**).  
  - Ensure you have a compatible OS (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04 for ROS Noetic, Ubuntu 22.04 for ROS2 Humble).
- **Python Version**  
  - Python 3.x (depending on ROS distribution, e.g., Python 3.8 for Ubuntu 20.04).
- **System Dependencies**  
  - `build-essential`, `cmake`, `git`, etc.  
  - `python3-pip` if you need additional Python packages.
- **Additional Packages**  
  - For AI modules: `tensorflow` or `torch` (optional).  
  - For sensor fusion: `robot_localization`, `cartographer`, or any other specialized packages.

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   cd ~/catkin_ws/src  # or colcon_ws/src for ROS2
   git clone https://github.com/kiranvenom1209/UIRP.git
Install Dependencies

bash
Copy
sudo apt-get update
# Example dependencies:
sudo apt-get install ros-${ROS_DISTRO}-navigation ros-${ROS_DISTRO}-robot-localization
# For AI (optional):
pip3 install tensorflow==2.6.0  # or torch==1.10.0
Build the Workspace

ROS1 (Catkin):
bash
Copy
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
ROS2 (Colcon):
bash
Copy
cd ~/colcon_ws
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
Environment Setup

Add source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash (ROS1) or source ~/colcon_ws/install/setup.bash (ROS2) to your ~/.bashrc to avoid repeating setup commands.
Configure any environment variables needed by AI modules or sensor fusion nodes in your .bashrc or a separate .env file.
Usage
Launch the Main System

bash
Copy
# ROS1 Example:
roslaunch uirp main.launch

# ROS2 Example:
ros2 launch uirp main.launch.py
This command typically starts up all essential nodes: AI inference node, sensor fusion node, navigation stack, etc.

Simulation

bash
Copy
# For a Gazebo simulation (example):
roslaunch uirp simulation.launch
This will spawn a virtual robot in Gazebo or another simulator with all the relevant sensors.

Configuration & Parameters

Located in config/.
Adjust these YAML files to match your robot’s sensor setup or AI model paths.
Command-Line Arguments

You can pass additional arguments to modify behavior (e.g., use_sim_time:=true, robot_model:=my_robot_x).
Example:
bash
Copy
roslaunch uirp main.launch use_sim_time:=true robot_model:=my_robot_x
